## Executive Summary

This document outlines the 30-day plan to take DiffForge from pre-launch to a revenue-generating product. The plan is divided into four weekly sprints, each with concrete deliverables, marketing actions, and measurable KPIs. Two revenue scenarios are modeled: Conservative and Aggressive.

## Revenue Targets

| Monthly Churn Rate | < 15% |
| Break-even Timeline | Month 2 |

Assumptions:
