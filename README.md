# DiffForge Launch Stack (Verified Diff-Asset Marketplace)

**What you get**
# DiffForge — Verified Diff-Asset Packs

## Stop rebuilding the same fixes.

If you clone websites or build automation systems,
you already know this:

You don’t fail because you can’t code.
You fail because **the same invisible issues repeat every time.**

Broken navigation.
Missing runtime behavior.
Dead internal routes.
API replay headaches.
Regression after every tweak.

DiffForge packages these recurring fixes as
**reusable, verified diff-assets.**

---

## What You Actually Get

✔ 25 production-ready diff-assets  
✔ Web clone runtime/navigation/API replay modules  
✔ Playwright-based regression smoke tests  
✔ Asset localization playbooks  
✔ Internal route discovery & router mapping  
✔ Definition-of-Done enforcement gate  

Each asset includes:

- META (problem definition)
- APPLY (exact steps)
- VERIFY (objective PASS rules)

No guesswork.
No “looks similar”.
Hard pass/fail criteria.

---

## Who This Is For

- Web cloning builders
- Automation system architects
- SaaS prototypers
- Teams that repeat site reconstruction workflows
- Developers tired of rediscovering the same bugs

---

## Why This Is Valuable

A single failed clone iteration costs:
- 2–10 hours debugging runtime
- 1–3 hours route discovery
- API replay trial & error
- Re-test cycles

DiffForge compresses that into:
→ Apply → Verify → Done

Time saved per project: 5–20+ hours

Multiply that across multiple builds.

---

## Structure

/assets → Diff-assets (META/APPLY/VERIFY)
/site   → Launch site skeleton
/docs   → Launch + verification playbooks
verify.py → 250-check validation script

---

## This Is Not

❌ A website template  
❌ A theme  
❌ A UI kit  

This is a **change mining factory output pack.**

## Next

This is v1.0.

Future packs will expand:

- Advanced API replay engine
- SPA router reconstruction
- Auth-state mocking modules
- Data fixture normalizers
- Enterprise-grade clone DOD gates

**You don’t buy code.  
You buy compressed experience.**
