## Bundle Strategy

The Pro Governance Bundle is designed to deliver complete coverage. Auth alone handles login and access control. But governance, ops, and security assets create the full operational foundation.

Purchasing individual domains would cost approximately ₩200,000+. The bundle delivers 25% savings with complete domain coverage.
